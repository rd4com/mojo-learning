## Why learning Mojo? 
**Unifying** the **high level** world and the **low level** world into a **single language** provides many great things:
- **choose how time is used on any part of the app** by switching from high level to low level (useful when prototyping or exploring ideas).
- **explore new lands/platforms** that were not steppable before (freedom, versatility and opportunities)
- **a progressive path to learn and grow** (by choosing the current level of abstraction).


There are three worlds at disposal:
- statically typed (Int64..) (*builtin* and custom structs)
- mojo's object *([Builtin.object](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/builtin/object.html),used in the example:[Matrix multiplication](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/Matmul.html#importing-the-python-implementation-to-mojo))*
- python object *(require: from Python import [PythonObject](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/python/object.html#pythonobject))*
            
Another is on it's way: [Roadmap: C/C++ Interop](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/roadmap.html#cc-interop) 
- would increase productivity by an significant factor (spending less time writing bindings)

Why learn it now?
- the language is still small so it is easy to learn as it grows
- by the time it is considered mature, being ready for action and already an experienced mojician.

*Note: Python have many packages and an active community of general purpose programmers and experts.*

## 🌅 A bright future ahead full of opportunities
It is easy to imagine that one person knowing mojo could one day be able to do: 
- 🌐 Web applications:
    - front end
      - potential for wasm: mojo apps have a small footprint
    - back end 
      - part of it being an ai running on a graphic card?
      - filtering audio signals as a web service?
      - provide to the front-end chart images?
- 💻 Desktop software
- 📱 Mobile apps
- ⏧ Robotics and IOT using micro-controllers
- 🤖 Performant A.I
- 🎮 video games
